Creating an agentic workflow for your requirement involves multiple components working together to ensure robust and reliable data extraction. Below is a **refined approach** to design this bot/script.

---

### **Proposed Workflow**

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Accept one or multiple URLs as input.
   - Validate URLs to ensure they are well-formed and reachable.

2. **Browsing Website**:
   - Simulate human browsing using tools like Puppeteer, Selenium, or Playwright to handle:
     - Dynamic content rendered via JavaScript.
     - Rate limiting by rotating user agents, IPs, and applying delays.

3. **App Presence Check**:
   - Look for App Store and Google Play icons by:
     - Analyzing the DOM for relevant patterns like `href` links pointing to `apps.apple.com` or `play.google.com`.
     - Using CSS selectors to identify icon elements.

4. **App Metadata Extraction** (if app found):
   - **Google Play Store**:
     - Use the Google Play API or scraper libraries (e.g., `google-play-scraper`) to fetch:
       - App downloads
       - Last updated date
       - Developer email
       - App store link
   - **App Store**:
     - Use the Apple App Store API or scraping libraries to extract:
       - App details
       - Last updated date
       - Developer email
       - App store link

5. **Fallback for Missing Apps**:
   - If no app is found:
     - Extract company details from sources like:
       - Crunchbase
       - LinkedIn
       - Company website (team page, about us, etc.)
     - Scrape or API fetch for:
       - Employee size
       - Funding status

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement retries for network errors or scraping failures.
   - Gracefully handle blocked access by switching to proxy or VPN.

7. **Output**:
   - Generate structured data (JSON/CSV) for each company:
     ```json
     {
       "company": "Example Inc.",
       "app_present": true,
       "google_play_data": {
         "link": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example",
         "downloads": "1M+",
         "last_updated": "2024-01-01",
         "developer_email": "support@example.com"
       },
       "app_store_data": {
         "link": "https://apps.apple.com/app/example-app/id123456789",
         "last_updated": "2024-01-01",
         "developer_email": "support@example.com"
       },
       "fallback_data": null
     }
     ```

### **Tech Stack**

1. **Headless Browsing**:
   - **Tool**: Puppeteer (Node.js), Playwright (Python/Node.js)
   - **Why**: Handles JS rendering, simulates human browsing.

2. **Scraping Libraries**:
   - `beautifulsoup4` (Python) for static scraping.
   - `selenium` for dynamic scraping.

3. **APIs**:
   - Use public APIs for app stores where possible to avoid scraping limitations.
   - Use company info APIs like LinkedIn or Crunchbase.

4. **Rate Limiting & Proxies**:
   - Use a service like Bright Data or ScraperAPI to manage IP rotations and avoid blocks.

5. **Storage**:
   - Use `pandas` or `csv` for structured data storage.
   - Optionally, store in databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for scaling.

### **Solutions for Previous Issues**

1. **False Negatives**:
   - Combine scraping with APIs for reliable data extraction.
   - Handle dynamic content with Puppeteer/Playwright.

2. **Incorrect Links**:
   - Match URLs specifically with `apps.apple.com` and `play.google.com`.
   - Validate app metadata against the company domain.

3. **Dynamic Rendering**:
   - Always use headless browsers to render JS before scraping.

4. **Rate Limiting & Blocks**:
   - Rotate proxies/IPs.
   - Respect rate limits with adaptive delays.

5. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process URLs in parallel with controlled concurrency to avoid overwhelming services.
